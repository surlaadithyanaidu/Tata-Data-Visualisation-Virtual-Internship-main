# Tasks

Task 1 - Framing the Business Scenario

Learned how to anticipate the questions, the business leaders will need answers to.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled and we need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective.

Task 2 - Choosing the Right Visuals

Learned which visuals are most effective in a given scenario and Choosing right charts based upon need such as Comparison, Distribution, Relationship, and Composition.

Task 3 - Creating Effective Visuals

We would need to provide insights which they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyse the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

We would need to make sure that the data we are using is of good quality and does not contain any bad data that would have an adverse impact on our analysis. Once the data is cleaned, the next step would be to create the visuals on Tableau.


Task 4 - Communicating Insights and Analysis

Effectively communicating the findings and explain how it relates to each scenario in a business friendly language.
